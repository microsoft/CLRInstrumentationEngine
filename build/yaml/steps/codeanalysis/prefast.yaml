# Increase the maximum cyclomatic complexity threshold.
# The cyclomatic complexity is the number of closed loops in a function + 1.
# A quick way to count this metric is to sum 1 plus the count of {IF FOR WHILE SWITCH BREAK RETURN OPERATOR.QUESTION OPERATOR.AND OPERATOR.OR CATCH} in the function body.
# Ideally we'd like to simplify the faulting methods and use the default (25), but for now we'll ignore them.
