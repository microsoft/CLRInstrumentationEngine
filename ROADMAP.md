# CLR Instrumentation Engine Road Map

The CLR Instrumentation Engine (CLRIE) roadmap provides the latest updates for the project priorities and upcoming work in supporting new features exposed by the runtime.

The CLRIE's goal is to provide the foundation for cooperation among profilers. Because of this, the project is owned by many individuals across different products at Microsoft. We also extend this cooperation to the community and encourate individuals, teams, and product owners to join us in making profiling a cooperative experience.
