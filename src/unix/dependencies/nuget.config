      <!-- The following PAT is generated from a low-priviledge account, and the PAT itself is restricted to
      the Package Manegement Read-Only scope. It does not have permissions to do anything on the VSTS account
      except for reading from the package feeds which the account is authorized to access. The PAT is
      intentionally checked in here so that cross-platform builds without AAD access can still get the required
      packages.

      The PAT will eventually expire after a year. A new one will then need to get regenerated and updated here. -->
